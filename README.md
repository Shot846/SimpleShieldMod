# Simple Shields for Doom
A Simple Shield mod that replaces Armor in Doom with Tiered Shields which recharges overtime and cannot be lost.

Currently there are 4 Shields:

###### Shield Type I - The Shield you spawn with.
Maximum Charge: 50
Delay: 10 seconds
Charge Rate: 1/9s

###### Shield Type II - Replaces Green Armor
Maximum Charge: 100
Delay: 8 seconds
Charge Rate: 1/9s

###### Shield Type III - Replaces Blue Armor
Maximum Charge: 200
Delay: 6 seconds
Charge Rate: 1/12s

###### Shield Type IV - Can randomly replace Megasphere (1/10 chance)
Maximum Charge: 300
Delay: 4 seconds
Charge Rate: 1/12s

## Compatibility with mods

The mod replaces:
- Green Armor
- Blue Armor
- Megasphere
- Armor Bonus

It doesn't replace the player, it's all ACS.

It also works perfectly in multiplayer.

Works in GZDoom/Zdoom/Zandronum3

Special Thanks to Jigsaw (Zandronum Forum Name) for introducing me to ACS.
